## A little bit about me
Thank you for being here with me.
My name is Long Luong. I come from Dalat, Vietnam.
I'm a fulltime researcher in the field of Finance. I'm a part time web developer, photographer, song writer.

## The things you can expect from me
In this blog, I will share with you guys about the things that I care the most, which are:

### Financial literacy
Financial freedom can brings us many things. And financial literacy is the stepping stone on the way to financial freedom.

### Technology
We're now living in the world surrounded by technology. So technology, why not?

### Life optimization
Sometime, we bought the latest iPhone, we use the lasted version of a software but do we fully utilize these devices?
